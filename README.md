# filament-dryer
A simple filament dryer for drying 1 kg spools of filament. It's based around an Ender 3 heater and fan, combined with a PCB and another sensor. All controlled via Klipper. More information on CAD, firmware and the PCB is available in the folders.

## BOM
In the BOM it uses a pico W because that is the only one LCSC has. You could also use a normal pico, but then you will need to get it from somewhere else.
