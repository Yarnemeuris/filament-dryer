# CAD
There is a step file with the whole filament dryer in it, including the PCB and not printed components. You can also visit the [Onshape document](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/1bd024d5b7959acafc85207a/w/bc3f431890b8dcf2703dc2b2/e/cdbebe0165cb72dab1a66bad?configuration=open%3Dfalse&renderMode=0&uiState=6928c6e1034c4c312e27572e), to view it and how I made it for yourself.

I have also included an STL file for each part to print. Which are orientated how I think you should print them (some have long bridges).

Lastly, there is also an OrcaSlicer 3MF file with the exact settings I used to print it.

## Print Settings
I don't have much to say here. I would recommend printing it from ABS or ASA, because it will get hot and PLA will melt. I used settings that aren't very strong but save filament. But it still is like 400 g.
