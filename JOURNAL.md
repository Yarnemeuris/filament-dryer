## 10/26/2025 - Made the schematic  

So this is the first day I'm working on this, but I had been thinking about it for some time. So it wasn't very difficult to make the schematic.

It's also not that complicated and I think I have everything. I also started working on the pcb.

I almost have the first version but it will change a lot while I'm making the model.  

## 10/29/2025 - worked on the schematic and pcb  

I forgot to add the thermistor connectors to the schematic and pcb. So I did that along with changing some components so that there are less different components. This is what the pcb looks like now.
